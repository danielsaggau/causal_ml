# Foundations of SCMs (1)

- System of equations with functions
- Assignment equation ':=' rather than regular equation '=' 
- Nonparametric SEM 
- This algebraic equation would imply that $B=A$ because the order has no concrete meaning in algebraic equations (symmetry)
- The initial $'='$ sign was replaced with the ':=' which is asymmetric (Pearl, 2009) and called an **assignment**.
- As mentioned, we define variables as functions e.g. $A=f_A(B,U_A)$.

**Error:* **
Regression: Omittable outside factor 
SCM/SEM; Latent influential factor that is pivotal for the model specification but not observable 

$$C:= N_c$$
$$E:=f_E(C,N_E)$$

# Assumptions in Causality 

Independence: 

- noise terms independent
- mechanisms independent (other variables invariant)(local changes)
- change in distribution stems from change in mechanism 

- Causal Markov Condition allows to factorize 
- Each Conditional is a causal mechanism

Source: [@peters_elements_2017]

# Assumptions in Causality (2)

**Established Conditions:**

Definition: **SUTVA**

'The treatment that one unit receives does not change the effect of treatment for any other unit.'[@hardtrecht]

Definition: **Consistency** 

The outcome Y agrees with the potential outcome corresponding to the treatment indicator.' [@hardtrecht]

Definition: **Ignorability**

The potential outcomes are conditionally independent of treatment given some set of de-confounding variables. [@hardtrecht]
(perfect RCT)

- First tow hold for SCM counterfactuals 
- third not testable but can check via backdoor criterion in SCM

# SCM Applications: 

- Flexible simulations for higher order problems (intervention, counterfactual)
- Graphical visualization via directed acyclic graph
- Example: SCM for fairness in dynamical system [@creager] : credit loan approval, time allocation, college admission  

# Fundamental Differences (1)

- conflict whether to use graphs or not 
* A SEM is a parametric specification used in applied sciences (parameters contested)
* A Bayesian causal network is another popular causal model using conditional probabilities and NO functions 
* Differences in performance between BCN and SCM# Performance Evaluation

# Pearls Causal Hierachy

# Prediction 

- ML, BN and regression are at the lowest level in the causal hierarchy
- Prediction methods demand the least information and depend on association alone
- Associational methods ignore external changes outside of our data.
- intervention distribution has information on these external changes.
- intervention distribution is only defined in high level causal methods. 

# Intervention 

- The second query deals with interventions
- Mathematical Tool: do-calculus
- The do-calculus enables us to study the manipulation of parent nodes
- There are various types of intervention
- One example is **atomic intervention,** where we set a variable to a constant
- In **policy intervention** we specify a different function for an equation
- Off-policy intervention models different intervention that is not in our historical data
- CBN , MDP and reinforcement learning model intervention.

# Example Intevention (1)
**Atomic Intervention**:

- by replacing function with a constant

$$C_1:= f_{c_1}(p,N_1) \rightarrow C_1:=600$$
$$C_2:= f_{c_2}(a,N_2)$$
$$E:=f_E(C_1,C_2,N_E)$$

# Example Intevention (2)

**Policy Intervention:**

- Intervention by replacing function with a different conditional probability

$$C_1:= f_{c_1}(p,N_1) \rightarrow C_1:=f(\pi)$$
$$C_2:= f_{c_2}(a,N_2)$$
$$E:=f_E(C_1,C_2,N_E)$$


# Counterfactuals 

- missing data problem in PO framework 

Process is described as follows:

(a) Abduction: Cast probability $P(u)$ as conditional probability $P(u|\epsilon)$ 
(b) Action: Exchange $(X = x)$ 
(c) Prediction: Compute $(Y = y)$

# Graphical Tools

- Nodes -> Variables (endogenous/exogenous)
- Edges -> relationship (equations)
- Parents/Ancestors/Descendents
- No need to specify exact parametric shape
- highlight colliders 
- estimation back door criterion 
- Test theoretical model structure via causal algorithms to detect structure in data (IC/PC Algo.)

# Causality and Time

- Time in Physical Sciences: Mechanical and exact 
- Time in Social Sciences: Often Vague 
- Regular Time Specification is also more vague 
- To accommodate that issue, research on differential equation based SCMs started

# Causal Modelling with Differential Equations 

Intial Value: 

$$
\mathbf{x}\left(t_{0}\right)=\mathbf{x}_{0}
$$



$$
\frac{d \mathbf{x}}{d t}=f(\mathbf{x}), \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{d}
$$

$$
\mathbf{x}(t+d t)=\mathbf{x}(t)+d t \cdot f(\mathbf{x}(t))
$$

- PO-Framework
- Causal Algorithms
- Causal Constraints Model 

# Conclusions 

- Assosicational learning is easy to model because of lower information neccessary
- but not always appropiate in high stake settings 
- SCM as expressive simulator for causal modelling outperforms many other models
- computational advantage casting causal model as system of assignment equations 
- Enables modelling of higher order concepts like counterfactuals 
- Extensions through differential equations for concise modelling of time
