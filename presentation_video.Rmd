# Introduction (1)

- Machine learning has provided many insights into different problems 
- One issue is the consideration of 'What are we actually predicting'?
- Mainstream tools are build on association-based learning 
- Associations are not enough for high stake settings 
- In disciplines like psychology or economics people are less interested in associational learning
- We want causation and not correlation 

# Introduction (2)

Causal assumptions differentiate causal models from association learning methods.

 | Association-based Concepts |  Causal Concepts
|--------------------------|------------------------|
| Correlation              | Randomization  
| Regression               | Confounding
| Conditional Independence | Disturbance
| Likelihood               | Error Terms      
| Odds Ratio               | Structural Coefficients       
| Propensity Score         | Spurious Correlation

# Assumptions (1)

- System of equations 
- Assignment equation ':=' rather than regular equation '=' 
- Nonparametric SEM 
- Functional form rather than using conditional probabilities
- SCM = PO + Graphical Tools

- Exogenous factors are part of the model specification

# Assumptions (2)

**Error terms**

Regression: Omittable outside factor 
SCM/SEM; Latent influential factor that is pivotal for the model specification but not observable 

Consists of graph and assignments: 
Baseline: 

$$C:= N_c$$
$$E:=f_E(C,N_E)$$

source: @peters_elements_2017

# Assumptions (3)

First, there was no sign to express the assignment equation and people used the '=' and one would e.g. write $A=B$.
Treating an equation as a **algebraic equation** led to confusion because those have no causal information.
This algebraic equation would imply that $B=A$ because the order has no concrete meaning in algebraic equations.
The problem is that the equation is symmetric.
The initial $'='$ sign was replaced with the ':=' which is asymmetric (Pearl, 2009) and called an **assignment**.
This misconception has caused a lot of challenges.^[For more information see @pearl2009causality]
As mentioned, we define variables as functions e.g. $A=f_A(B,U_A)$.

# Assumptions (4)

**Independence**

*Definition:*

# SCM Applications: 

- Flexible simulations for higher order problems (intervention, counterfactual)
- Graphical visualization via directed acyclic graph

# Comparative Causal Tools 

# Historical Development 

* Path Analysis -> SEM -> SCM

# Fundamental Differences (1)

- conflict whether to use graphs or not 
* A SEM is a parametric specification used in applied sciences (parameters contested)
* A Bayesian causal network is another popular causal model using conditional probabilities and NO functions 
* Differences in performance between BCN and SCM# Performance Evaluation

# Implications

# Prediction 

 -ML, BN and regression are at the lowest level in the causal hierarchy
- Prediction methods demand the least information and depend on association alone
- Associational methods ignore external changes outside of our data.
- intervention distribution has information on these external changes.
- intervention distribution is only defined in high level causal methods. 

# Intervention 

The second query deals with interventions.
Here we can use @pearl2009causality do-calculus.
The do-calculus enables us to study the manipulation of parent nodes.
 There are various types of intervention.
One example is **atomic intervention,** where we set a variable to a constant.
In **policy intervention** we specify a different function for an equation.
off-policy intervention models different intervention that is not in our historical data [@oberst2019counterfactual].
Causal bayesian networks , Markov Decision Processes (MDP) and reinforcement learning model intervention.

# Counterfactuals 

Process is described as follows:

(a) Abduction: Cast probability $P(u)$ as conditional probability $P(u|\epsilon)$ 
(b) Action: Exchange $(X = x)$ 
(c) Prediction: Compute $(Y = y)$

# Causality and Time

- Time in Physical Sciences: Mechanical and exact 
- Time in Social Sciences: Often Vague 
- Regular Time Specification is also more vague 
- To accomodate that issue, research on differential equation based SCMs started
